          I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building scalable,
          user-centric applications. With expertise spanning frontend
          frameworks, backend systems, and AI/ML integration, I create solutions
          that are both beautiful and functional.

          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring emerging technologies
          like Web3, 3D graphics, or contributing to open-source projects. I
          believe in continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's
          possible on the web.
